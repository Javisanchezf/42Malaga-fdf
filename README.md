## About

FDF is a project that aims to create a simple 3D height-map renderer. The program takes a map file as input and creates a graphical representation of it. The program allows for basic manipulations of the map and the rendering. [You can find more information in the subject](https://github.com/Javisanchezf/42Malaga-pdfs/blob/main/fdf_subject.pdf).

The code in this repository follows [the rules of the Norminette](https://github.com/Javisanchezf/42Malaga-pdfs/blob/master/norme.pdf).

This is the result of the program:

## Requirements
The project is written in __C language__ and needs:
- Compiler `gcc`.
-  The following  standard libraries:
	- `<stdlib.h>`
	- `<unistd.h>`
	- `<stdlib.h>`
	- `<math.h>`
- Software development tool `GLFW`.

## Instructions

### 1. Download the repository

To download the repository, go to the console and run:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Javisanchezf/42Malaga-fdf.git
cd 42Malaga-fdf
```

### 2. Compiling the library

To compile the library, go to its path and run:

```
make
```
If you have a fault, it is possible that you do not meet the aforementioned requirements. The most common is not having glfw installed, you can do it by:
```
brew install glfw
```

### 3. Cleaning all binary (.o) executable files (.a) and the program

To delete all files generated with make, go to the path and run:
```
make fclean
```
### 4. Using it


You can test the FDF with different maps, you have several maps to test in the maps folder, try the following:
```
./fdf maps/42.fdf
```

## Testing
This library have been tested by several students from Fundación 42 following the correction script provided by the school.

## Tips

To rotate the figure:

At the beginning angle1 = angle2 = 0º, and to rotate the figure you only have to vary those angles.
- x (With angles) = x * cos(angle1) - y * sin(angle1)
- y (With angles) = x * sin(angle1) + y * cos(angle1) * cos(angle2) - z * sin(angle2)
- z (With angles) = y * sin(angle2) - z * cos(angle2)


Perspectives to convert in FDF:
- Isometric
	- Xi =  x * cos(30º) + y * sen(30º)
	- Yi =  x * sen(30º) + y * cos(30º) - z
- Cavalier
	- Xc = (x - z * cos(45º)) - (y - z * sen(45º)) * cos(45º)
	- Yc = y - z * sen(45º)
- Top view
	- Xt = x
	- Yt = y
- Frontal view
	- Xf = x + y
	- Yf = -z

Conversions:
- 1 ° × π / 180 = 0,01745 rad
